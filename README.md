VBA Challenge assignment required to do make ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, total stock volume, and conditional formatting that highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

I frist name the column where the summary result can be inserted.
I assigned variables to hold the data that I want.
I also dim the variables.
I calculated the total stock volume first, since Dr.A recommended to do that part before anything using the credit card exercise that we did in class.
I then calculated yearly change and percent change using simple math and formated into currency and percentage.
After, I color coded the yearly change column to highlight negative in red and positive in green.
I used WorksheetFunction to calculate greatest percent incerease, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume. 
Last, after creating code to work, I work a script that runs to all the worksheet.

Thank you!
